We share data from N=96 healthy adults (44 females, 52 males; age 18-37, mean = 20.75, s.d = 3.17) who underwent extensive a maze learning exploration and test phases with 3 Tesla functional neuroimaging to examine the neural basis of individual differences during active navigation. 

## Description of the data and file structure


Behavioural data are available xx.

To note:
	In general, a lower score on the efficiency variable means higher efficiency, and a higher score on the accuracy variable means higher accuracy.

Demographics.xlsx contains demographic data.

3T MRI data are available in zipped folders and were preprocessed by fMRIPrep.

Scripts are available in zipped folder.
