We share data from N=96 healthy adults (44 females, 52 males; age 18-37, mean = 20.75, s.d = 3.17) who underwent extensive a maze learning exploration and test phases with 3 Tesla functional neuroimaging to examine the neural basis of individual differences during active navigation. 

## Description of the data and file structure

Behavioural data are available in 'behavioral_data', which includes demographic data, behavioral data at trial level (2 files), and behavioral data at participant level (including overall navigation performance and efficiency). Note: In general, a lower score on the efficiency variable means higher efficiency, and a higher score on the accuracy variable means higher accuracy. For details of each file, please refer to Spatial Neuroscience Lab github [repostiory](https://github.com/spatialneuroscience/MLINDIV/tree/main/Preprocessing/Behavioral).

3T MRI (including fMRI and T1) data are available in folder 'behavioral_data' and were preprocessed by fMRIPrep.

Scripts are available in folder 'scripts', including scripts for generating beta series files, and for mvpa analyses.

Atlas data are nifti files and labels for subcortical atlas and cortical atlas.
